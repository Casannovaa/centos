# SOFT BOUNCE
#
# The soft_bounce parameter provides a limited safety net for
# testing.  When soft_bounce is enabled, mail will remain queued that
# would otherwise bounce. This parameter disables locally-generated
# bounces, and prevents the SMTP server from rejecting mail permanently
# (by changing 5xx replies into 4xx replies). However, soft_bounce
# is no cure for address rewriting mistakes or mail routing mistakes.

# LOCAL PATHNAME INFORMATION
#
# The queue_directory specifies the location of the Postfix queue.

# The inet_interfaces parameter specifies the network interface

# to user@[the.net.work.address] of an interface that the mail system
# receives mail on (see the inet_interfaces parameter).
#
# Specify a list of host or domain names, /file/name or type:table
# patterns, separated by commas and/or whitespace. A /file/name

# REJECTING MAIL FOR UNKNOWN LOCAL USERS
#
# The local_recipient_maps parameter specifies optional lookup tables
# with all names or addresses of users that are local with respect
# to \$mydestination, \$inet_interfaces or \$proxy_interfaces.
#
# If this parameter is defined, then the SMTP server will reject
# mail for unknown local users. This parameter is defined by default.
#
# To turn off local recipient checking in the SMTP server, specify
# local_recipient_maps = (i.e. empty).
#
# The default setting assumes that you use the default Postfix local
# delivery agent for local delivery. You need to update the
# local_recipient_maps setting if:
#
# - You define \$mydestination domain recipients in files other than
#   /etc/passwd, /etc/aliases, or the \$virtual_alias_maps files.
#   For example, you define \$mydestination domain recipients in    
#   the \$virtual_mailbox_maps files.
#
# - You redefine the local delivery agent in master.cf.
#
# - You redefine the \"local_transport\" setting in main.cf.
#
# - You use the \"luser_relay\", \"mailbox_transport\", or \"fallback_transport\"
#   feature of the Postfix local delivery agent (see local(8)).
#
# Details are described in the LOCAL_RECIPIENT_README file.
#
# Beware: if the Postfix SMTP server runs chrooted, you probably have
# to access the passwd file via the proxymap service, in order to
# overcome chroot restrictions. The alternative, having a copy of
# the system passwd file in the chroot jail is just not practical.
#
# The right-hand side of the lookup tables is conveniently ignored.
# In the left-hand side, specify a bare username, an @domain.tld
# wild-card, or specify a user@domain.tld address.

# \${proxy,inet}_interfaces, while \$local_recipient_maps is non-empty
# and the recipient address or address local-part is not found.
#
# The default setting is 550 (reject mail) but it is safer to start

# TRUST AND RELAY CONTROL

# clients that have more privileges than \"strangers\".
#
# In particular, \"trusted\" SMTP clients are allowed to relay mail
# through Postfix.  See the smtpd_recipient_restrictions parameter
# in postconf(5).

# clients in the same IP subnetworks as the local machine.
# On Linux, this does works correctly only with interfaces specified
# with the \"ifconfig\" command.
# 
# Specify \"mynetworks_style = class\" when Postfix should \"trust\" SMTP
# clients in the same IP class A/B/C networks as the local machine.
# Dont do this with a dialup site - it would cause Postfix to \"trust\"

# Specify \"mynetworks_style = host\" when Postfix should \"trust\"
# only the local machine.

# Alternatively, you can specify the mynetworks list by hand, in
# which case Postfix ignores the mynetworks_style setting.
#
# Specify an explicit list of network/netmask patterns, where the
# mask specifies the number of bits in the network part of a host
# address.
#
# You can also specify the absolute pathname of a pattern file instead
# of listing the patterns here. Specify type:table for table-based lookups
# (the value on the table right-hand side is not used).

# The relay_domains parameter restricts what destinations this system will
# relay mail to.  See the smtpd_recipient_restrictions description in
# postconf(5) for detailed information.
#
# By default, Postfix relays mail
# - from \"trusted\" clients (IP address matches \$mynetworks) to any destination,
# - from \"untrusted\" clients to destinations that match \$relay_domains or
#   subdomains thereof, except addresses with sender-specified routing.
# The default relay_domains value is \$mydestination.

# In addition to the above, the Postfix SMTP server by default accepts mail
# that Postfix is final destination for:
# - destinations that match \$inet_interfaces or \$proxy_interfaces,
# - destinations that match \$mydestination
# - destinations that match \$virtual_alias_domains,
# - destinations that match \$virtual_mailbox_domains.
# These destinations do not need to be listed in \$relay_domains.
# 
# Specify a list of hosts or domains, /file/name patterns or type:name
# lookup tables, separated by commas and/or whitespace.  Continue
# long lines by starting the next line with whitespace. A file name
# is replaced by its contents; a type:name table is matched when a
# (parent) domain appears as lookup key.

# The relayhost parameter specifies the default host to send mail to

# no relayhost is given, mail is routed directly to the destination.
#
# On an intranet, specify the organizational domain name. If your
# internal DNS uses no MX records, specify the name of the intranet
# gateway host instead.
#
# In the case of SMTP, specify a domain, host, host:port, [host]:port,

# to an SCO bug).
# 
# A Postfix process will pause for \$in_flow_delay seconds before
# accepting a new message, when the message arrival rate exceeds the

# doesn't yet have any mail, so you should explicitly tell Dovecot the full

# isn't enough. You'll also need to tell Dovecot where the other mailboxes are
# kept. This is called the \"root mail directory\", and it must be the first
# path given in the mail_location setting.
#
# There are a few special variables you can use, eg.:
#
#   %u - username
#   %n - user part in user@domain, same as %u if there's no domain
#   %d - domain part in user@domain, empty if there's no domain
#   %h - home directory

# are for user's personal mails. Shared namespaces are for accessing other
# users' mailboxes that have been shared. Public namespaces are for shared
# mailboxes that are managed by sysadmin. If you create any shared or public
# namespaces you'll typically want to enable ACL plugin also, otherwise all
# users can access all the shared mailboxes, assuming they have permissions
# on filesystem level to do so.

#  dotlock_try: Same as dotlock, but if it fails because of permissions or
#               because there isn't enough disk space, just skip it.
#  fcntl  : Use this if possible. Works with NFS too if lockd is used.
#  flock  : May not exist in all systems. Doesn't work with NFS.
#  lockf  : May not exist in all systems. Doesn't work with NFS.
#
# You can use multiple locking methods; if you do the order they're declared

# new mails. If this setting is enabled, Dovecot does this but still safely
